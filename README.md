## Hi there fellow dev people 👋
---

Well, I'm not too sure how to start this... so here we go!

## Current Projects

- A silly browser game extension which currently only lets you change your in-game skin to something custom you can find the repo [Here](https://github.com/chickenpoo351/chickenPoo-Amazing-Survev-Client)
- Surprisingly enough a web based MMORTS (yeah I'm not sure why I chose to do this... but it's been fun so far :D) you can view the dev build by going [Here](https://iron-frontiers-a-global-wargame.pages.dev/)

- And that's everything I'm working on right now... maybe I will add more projects or maybe I won't I dont know :p

## Known Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- *(I know HTML and CSS aren't exactly programming languages, but we don't need to be so technical 😅)*

## Fun stuff about me :D

- In case you couldn't tell I am a web developer :D
- For some reason, when I was learning web dev, I thought frameworks and libraries were far too complicated / scary. So instead of using them, I made my life harder and wrote everything in vanilla JavaScript (or HTML / CSS depending on the situation).
- I'm self taught :D which basically means I learned the bare minimum and went from there 🤣
